# RandomUser_iOS_MVP
A small app to demonstrate the MVP architecture in the iOS development.

It contains some well-known and well-tested external libraries, for instance Alamofire and Moya for the networking, Kingfisher for the images, and Hero for the transitions. The app is designed with the Separation of Concern (SoC) and SOLID principles.

The app contains a lot of comments, so it's easy to pick up the thread. If you have any suggestions, please contact me!

Tests will be coming in the near future.
